    "# Whisky Recommender Demo\n",
    "This notebook includes a demo of the Whisky Recommender.  There are a number of interactive cells that you can use to see and try out various features of the recommender.  The ultimate aim is that the recommender can be used as a backend of a web app, and thus most interactions happen using dictionaries. This is slightly awkward for an individual user hoping to get a whisky recommendation, however this serves a purpose more as a proof or concept."
