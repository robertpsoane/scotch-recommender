    "# Whisky Recommender Demo\n",
    "This notebook includes a demo of the Whisky Recommender.  There are a number of interactive cells that you can use to see and try out various features of the recommender.  The ultimate aim is that the recommender can be used as a backend of a web app, and thus most interactions happen using dictionaries. This is slightly awkward for an individual user hoping to get a whisky recommendation, however this serves a purpose more as a proof or concept."

Hints of brown sugar, pear drops, a little vanilla and cooked apple add sweetness among notes of spare ribs, lemon sherbet, black pepper and wood shavings. I love this nose, it’s smoky and musty and like standing by a seaside bonfire.\",\n",
    "    \"Palate\" : \"The palate is very pleasantly sweet and salty. Citrus oils and orchard fruits are present along with an unmistakable dark berry tartness which is joined by plenty of damp peat and dry wood smoke. Adding depth there’s pepper steak, creosote and then some touches of clove and liquorice. In the back-end, there’s a juicy sweetness from lychee and peaches as well as just a touch of salted caramel.\",\n",
