# Data Analysis and Preprocessing

This directory contains the initial scripts used for the following purposes:

- Scraping masterofmalt.com

- Experimenting with feature selection

- Initial prototypical recommendation engine

Many parts of this code is copied in the agent design folder - this is so that the design process is hopefully more clear to a reader/marker. The rough scripts and functions in here are not expected to be `production-ready`; they are kept for completeness.
