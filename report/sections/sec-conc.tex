\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conc}
This project sought to investigate whether NLP techniques could be applied to free text tasting notes 
to produce an effective Scotch whisky recommender engine.

Acting on an environment consisting of a retailers website, an autonomous
agent was produced with capacity to maintain an updated language model for Scotch whisky. This model
can reflect changes in the Scotch lexicon, and be applied effectively to recommend whisky on the basis of
taste. This could have significant positive consequences for whisky buyers.

Due to the sparsity of the field, there is a wealth of space for exploration, with a few suggestions listed
in \autoref{sssec:future}.  Despite promising early results, a more comprehensive study is needed, ideally
with a larger sample size and/or industry experts.

\subsection{Suggestions for Future Work}\label{sssec:future}

The following suggestions are made for future work and research to build upon this project.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Development of a front end UI.
    \item Further comparisons and research into KE methods for whisky tasting notes.
    \item Investigations into semantic language models and alternative similarity measures.
    \item Work on whisky clustering to research flavour profile metrics.
    \item Further evaluation of effectiveness of the agent.
    \item Work with industry experts to evaluate and improve the agent.
\end{itemize}
