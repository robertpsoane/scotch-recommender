\section{Scotch: Distilled}\label{sec:whisky}
This project concerns itself with the specific domain of Scotch. To fully understand the problem at hand, a basic
understanding of the drink is required.  In this section I present a brief overview of Scotch, 
and a summary of its lexicon.

\subsection{A Brief Overview of Scotch}
Scotch whisky refers to whisky produced in Scotland fulfilling a set of legal requirements set by the UK Government 
\cite{legislation.gov.uk_2009}.\footnote{This report concerns Scotch whisky, and thus \emph{Scotch} and \emph{whisky} 
are used interchangeably.}  Grains are allowed to malt (germinate) to develop their sugars, after which sugars are
extracted producing a syrup, which is fermented producing a sweet hop-free beer.  This is
distilled in \emph{pot stills} to increase the alcohol content making \emph{new-make spirit}. This
is matured in oak casks for a minimum of 3 years, prior to bottling.  At this stage the distiller may choose
to dilute the whisky to an ABV of no less than $40\%$ \cite{Jacques2003, Pyke1965}.

\subsection{Whisky and Words}
The flavours present in Scotch come from a number of sources, in turn influencing how various whisky
flavour profiles are described.  To stop the grain germinating, it is heated. Some distilleries use
a peat fire to do this.  This imparts a smokey flavour onto the grain, which carries through to the end spirit.
This smokey flavour is described as \emph{peated} \cite{Jacques2003, Bathgate2019}.

Maturation provides another opportunity to add flavour to the drink.  Age all Scotch in 
oak casks is resource intensive, and has lead to distilleries purchasing used casks from other drinks manufacturers.
Traditionally the sherry industry has supplied used casks to distilleries. More recently, bourbon casks have been 
used.  Any cask which has previously held any drink can be used, be it for the entire maturation process, or at the end
such as a \emph{sherry cask finish}.  These all add their own flavours to the drink, which is reflected in 
tasting notes \cite{Jacques2003, Mosedale1998}.
